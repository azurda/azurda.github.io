      <description>We are able to read function arguments with FRIDA using the args:NativePointer[] array. However, this is not possible with arguments that are not simple types such as structs.
Where can we find structs? We can find structs in the Unix time libraries for example, or more importantly in Windows&amp;rsquo;s APICALLs such as the ones in NTDLL.
Stages:
 Understanding and reading a user-controlled struct. Reading a UNIX syscall structure. Reading a Windows NTDLL structure.</description>
